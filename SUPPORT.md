## How to Ask Good Questions

### DO ✅

- Provide **context**: What are you trying to achieve?
- Include **error messages**: Exact error text and stack traces
- Share **reproduction steps**: Minimal, complete, and verifiable example
- Mention your **environment**: OS, Node version, browser/device
- Show what you **already tried**
- Be **specific** about what's not working

### DON'T ❌

- "It doesn't work" — What exactly doesn't work?
- "Help me" — With what specifically?
- Screenshots of code instead of text
- Pasting large code blocks without context
- Asking if you can ask a question (just ask!)

3. Press the play button
4. No audio plays

## What I Tried
